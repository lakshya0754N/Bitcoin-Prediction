# Bitcoin-Prediction
Virtual currencies are a form of cryptocurrency which is an impressive technical achievement in
digital marketing, nevertheless. Virtual currencies live on, and they couldn’t fully replace fiat or
conventional currencies. In the current study, we are trying to show an interesting new
perspective from the view of economics questions surrounding currency governance, the
characteristics of money, political economy of financial intermediaries, and the nature of
currency computation.
Primarily, the main challenge of the bitcoin exchange rate is its high rate of price fluctuation.
The objective of our current study is to forecast the bitcoin price with improved efficiency using
machine learning models and minimizing the risks for investors as well as policy-makers.

There are various classification algorithms present out of which I shall implement the following:
● Decision Tree Regressor
● XGBRegressor
● Linear Regressor
● Random Forest
● LSTM
